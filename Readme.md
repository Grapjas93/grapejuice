Branch to prepare the mod for the next upcoming alpha version.

Changes so far:
- Enemy player info is hidden in the diplomacy panel.
    - Players will get a clickable notification (location) if they meet an undiscovered player, this will fill in some info at the diplomacy panel. Notification can be disabled at settings > game settings.
- Chariots have a melee attack aswell: Pike, with a counter against cavalry as usual.
